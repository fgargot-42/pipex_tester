# Pipex Tester
_Created by fgargot_

## Purpose

This is a tester for pipex. It runs a bunch of tests on your pipex program and checks for errors in output file, status codes and leaks/open fds via Valgrind.

## How to use

Clone this repo to your pipex directory, go to that directory and run ```test.sh```.

You can also move the script and edit the ```pipex_dir``` variable to the path of your program.
